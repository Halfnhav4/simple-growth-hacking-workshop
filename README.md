# growth-hacking-workshop
The success of an app or a start up is in having an active user base. Therefore building is the easiest part of building a startup hard part is gaining and keeping users.

We will build a simple small way to build a user base before or after product launch without using much code. You can follow along by using the assests in this project or using your own to growth hack a product, website or yourself. 

Growth hacking is the process of gaining users, keeping them and spreading your app through other users.

##Goals
Through this workshop we hope to accomplish the following

1. Set up A/B Tests and Analytics.

2. Identify tools to gain users.

3. Use a simple bot to automate the process of gaining users.

4. Gain a solid overview of what growth hacking is.


##Process

1. Understand our user base
2. Gain Website visitors
3. Gain sign ups
4. Retain users
5. Gain Referrals 
6. Learn / Fix
7. Scale

##Tools

* Websta.me - view hashtag activity
* Instagram - profile to use
* Instagress - Bot
* Optimizely - A/B Testing
* Google Analytics - Analytics
* GitHub Pages - Website
* Typeform - Sign Up Form

######Let's Get Started

##Step 1 - Understand Targeted Users
We will be targeting users who enjoy sneakers. Therefore it would be smart to think about where our user base can be found and what they do/possible pain points.
For this we will assume the user base is mainly on Instagram and we will look through and find a couple use cases that may attract users. 

######Note: We also want to pay attention to the type of user we are appealing to.

1. Let's visit [Websta.me](https://websta.me)

2. Type in some hashtags 

3. Point out use cases

* [ ] use case 1
* [ ] use case 2
* [ ] use case 3

We now understand the type of user we are appealing to. Our goal is to get them to sign up for the beta version but to do that we need the following: 

* Set Up Website
* Create Sign Up Form
* A message to say

##Step 2 - Set Up Website
We will use Github Pages to set up the website. (optional)
If you have a Website that you can change feel free to use that instead and skip to step 3
Otherwise continue. 

1. Clone this respository on your computer 
2. Follow these directions to set up your [Github page](https://pages.github.com/)
3. Copy the files from this respository and put them into your Github Pages Respository.

We now have a website up and running. 
Lets create a sign up form using Typeform. 

##Step 3 - Set up Typeform
Type form is a nice form generator. It removes the hassle of creating a sign up form quick and easy. 

1. Sign Up for [Typeform](http://typeform.com)
2. Create a type form 
3. Add the form link to the website

######We have both the website and the Typeform. Lets add some tracking and A/B testing. Then we can move on to sending out messages

##Step 4 - Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a great way to view how your site is being used, performance, and demographics. Their are many other tools such as KissMetrics and my now favorite Heap but to keep things simple lets use a standard tool. 

####Add to Website
1. Sign Up for [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics)
2. Create a new web account
3. Add the link to your site and push the changes to GitHub

####Add to Typeform
1. Create a new property under the same web account
2. Add the ID to the typeform 



##Step 5 - Optimizely
Here we can add multiple versions of our site. With this we can change the value proposition, the look and feel of the site. 

1. Create an Optimizely account. 
2. Start a new project
3. Add at least 3 different variations to your site
4. Click the Launch button
5. Add the code snippet to your website and push the changes. 

######We now have a site we are A/B testing and our analytics are installed as well. 

##Step 6 - Message
Here we will use Instagress to send out messages for us using Instagram Hashtags, comments and likes. 

1. Sign up for [Instagress](http://instagress.com)
2. Create a list of hashtags to target users with
3. Create the multiple messages you'd like to send to users.
4. Click start process and let it run. 

##Step 7 - Learn & Fix 
So you launched a campaign to gain beta users. Things are moving by itself while you focus on developing but...are things going smoothly. 

Maybe their are somethings you need to optimize. 

1. Lets look into optimizely to see how we can do it. 

##Step 8 - Scale
Upon nailing your process you can scale it. 

Example: 
Develop an Instagram bot for better algorithms to allow your connection to be more personal.
